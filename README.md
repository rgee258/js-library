# JS Library

This repository contains a small library app for submitting the details of a book and displaying it. You can not only add books but also remove them and change their status of whether they've been read or not.

This app was created for the purpose of practicing with object constructors in JS and making use of the prototype capabilities in the language.

Code for saving the library to localstorage is included but when I tested it across two different browsers I had issues accessing them, so although it is implemented to an extent it may or may not work. It may be revisited in the future.
